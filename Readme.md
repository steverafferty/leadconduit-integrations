# LeadConduit Integrations Development Guide

This branch (`gh-pages`) is entirely separate from `master` or any feature branches. That's on purpose; it should not be rebased to or from those.

To update the guide:

1. edit the source text in `/sections`
2. run `npm run-script generateguide`
3. commit and push to the `gh-pages` branch

Read the generated formatted guide [here](http://activeprospect.github.io/leadconduit-integrations/).
