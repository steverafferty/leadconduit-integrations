# 8. Appendix C - Running Locally

_Note: although this guide is currently published publicly, if you're outside the ActiveProspect organization, the information in this section isn't of use to you, and can be ignored._

**todo: flesh out this section with full details of how to `npm link`, etc.**

## Tips & Tricks

1. To verify what's being served by the LC API:

    a. Broad check for modules (this should return all the integration names): `curl -X GET -H 'Accept: application/json' http://leadconduit.localhost/packages | jq '.[] | .id' | grep suppressionlist`

    b. Full detail for one integration (including, for example, the boolean `package.ui` that indicates a "rich UI" is included in the module): `curl -X GET -H 'Accept: application/json' http://leadconduit.localhost/packages | jq '.[] | select(.id == "leadconduit-suppressionlist.outbound.add_item")'`

2. To search modules installed on the filesystem, run this from your LC root directory: `find . -name "leadconduit-suppressionlist" -print -follow -exec grep version {}/package.json \;`

3. To verify the exact version loaded by LC:
    a. In the app root directory run `node`
    b. `x = require('@activeprospect/leadconduit-integrations')` (this takes a moment)
    c. `x.packages['leadconduit-suppressionlist']`
